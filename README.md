# Pathfinder.
Very early stage.


# 00:02, Feb. 16, 2022:
Custom simulations (at least an alpha implementation of them) has been completed.
I almost certainly have to release those under a new plugin, they're too developed to solely be a part of this plugin.

I'm not sure how many features I should include in CheapPhysics.ts (src/classes/physics/engines/cheapPhysics.ts).
Right now, there's one tick of block collision detection (allowing an initial jump) and then nothing.
I'll have to look into it, but I think I need block collision to predict player inputs (another project in the works).

Well, not much else to do for tonight. I'm logging off, cya fuckers.# mineflayer-alpha-pather
